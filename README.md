# ATM-System
This is a simple ATM system made using C++. It allows users to create an account, log in, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. All transactions are saved in a text file named `trans_history.txt`. It uses basic C++ concepts like structures, file handling, and conditionals to simulate an ATM experience in the console.
